# EzQuiz
Hello! This was my 2019-2020 FBLA Coding & Programming project EzQuiz. I created this my junior year of highschool.
I have kept all of the code and files as is, not modifing them since the last commit I did before presenting at nationals.
This project contains the entire front end of EzQuiz.
